# SparkControlEmulation_ESP32_LOLIN32_Lite
Spark Control emulation using an ESP32 Lolin32 lite 

The work has been done by Paul Hamshere and he actually helped with the card as it was not connecting to my MINI at all 

it works flowlessly now and as I had a screen on the box it just will display the LOLIN and Spark Control on the little OLED 

you can use all the function of the control like it was the Spark Control itself 
nothing is missing 

thank you Paul for the amazing job
